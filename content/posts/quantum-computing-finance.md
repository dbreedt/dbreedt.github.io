The rapid advancements in quantum computing research have positioned it
as both a force for innovation and a looming threat to the financial
sector. While some celebrate groundbreaking discoveries, others amplify
concerns over the risks quantum computing may pose to financial
institutions.

The United Nations has declared 2025 the [*International Year of Quantum
Science and Technology*](https://quantum2025.org/), and experts speculate about the
so-called [‘Q-Day’](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/q-day-is-coming-is-the-world-prepared/)—the 
moment when quantum computers will be capable of breaking the cryptographic systems that secure digital
communications and transactions.

Financial institutions are already preparing for this shift. HSBC, in
collaboration with [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-03-29-HSBC-Working-with-IBM-to-Accelerate-Quantum-Computing-Readiness), [anticipates](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/ai-quantum-technologies-transforming-financial-industry/) that the
financial services industry will be among the first to be transformed by quantum computing and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI)—a convergence now referred to as *AQ*. Echoing this view, AI and 
quantum computing were key discussion points at the [*Singapore FinTech Festival*](https://www.fintechfestival.sg/) in
November 2024.

While quantum computing itself is not new, the excitement around its potential to go mainstream within the next few years is growing.

## **Opportunities for the Financial Sector**

AQ offers exponentially faster data processing, which could transform risk mitigation, fraud 
detection, and financial modelling. By enhancing machine learning, it has the potential to reshape:

- **Risk estimation and trading strategies** – uncovering hidden
  > correlations in vast datasets to improve market predictions.

- **Customer analytics and personalisation** – enabling banks, insurers,
  > and investment firms to provide smarter, AI-driven financial advice
  > tailored to individual risk profiles.

- **Real-time risk analysis and portfolio optimisation** – allowing for
  > more precise decision-making.

- **Insurance** – improving risk assessment, dynamic pricing, and fraud
  > detection, leading to hyper-personalised policies with greater
  > predictive accuracy.

This technological leap is expected to drive efficiency and innovation
across the financial sector.

## **Risks for the Financial Sector**

Quantum computing also introduces significant risks, particularly in
cybersecurity. Algorithms such as **Shor's Algorithm** and **Grover's
Algorithm** could undermine the cryptographic protections that currently
safeguard digital communications and transactions:

- **Shor's Algorithm** enables polynomial-time factorisation of large
  > integers, threatening RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography
  > (ECC)—which underpin authentication, transaction verification, and
  > secure communications.

- **Grover’s Algorithm** accelerates brute-force attacks on symmetric
  > encryption, reducing the effective key length of encryption
  > standards like AES.

For financial institutions, the potential impact extends beyond
encryption:

- **Compromised authentication mechanisms** – attackers could
  > impersonate systems, manipulate transaction records, or gain
  > unauthorised access to sensitive data.

- **Vulnerabilities in cryptocurrencies** – Bitcoin wallets, which rely
  > on ECC, could be at risk if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer
  > derives private keys from public ones.

Although quantum computers could theoretically break these encryption methods, doing so would 
require [**fault-tolerant quantum machines with millions of stable qubits**](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2021/08/24/quantum-attack-resource-estimate-using-shors-algorithm-to-break-rsa-vs-dh-dsa-vs-ecc/). 
Currently, the most advanced quantum computers operate with only a few thousand *noisy* qubits, 
making these threats largely theoretical for now.

## **The Current State of Quantum Computing**

Despite significant [*progress*](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/quantum-computing-in-2024-the-state-of-play/), 
quantum computing remains far from mainstream adoption. Major challenges include:

- **Qubit stability and error correction** – as quantum computers scale,
  > maintaining coherence becomes increasingly difficult.

- **Extreme operating conditions** – most systems require temperatures
  > near absolute zero.

- **The need for millions of qubits** – breaking RSA-2048 encryption,
  > for example, is estimated to require around **6,190 logical
  > qubits**, translating into millions of physical qubits when
  > accounting for error correction.

While research continues at a rapid pace, many experts believe it will
take a decade before quantum computers can reliably break classical
encryption.

## **Looking Ahead**

Quantum computing is advancing, but mainstream adoption remains distant.
Several breakthroughs—such as [**room-temperature superconductors**](https://www.eetimes.eu/the-status-of-room-temperature-quantum-computers/), 
[**mechanical**](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2406.07360)
[ **qubits**](https://phys.org/news/2024-11-physicists-fully-mechanical-qubit.html), or 
[**Google’s new Willow chip**](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/)—could
help overcome existing limitations. For now, access to quantum computing remains expensive and largely 
limited to [*cloud-based services*](https://thequantuminsider.com/2022/05/03/13-companies-offering-quantum-cloud-computing-services-in-2022/).

Meanwhile, cryptographic experts are actively developing [**post-quantum cryptographic standards**](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/08/us-tools-encryption-breaking-quantum-computing-nist/) to mitigate potential
threats. [*Industry commentary*](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computing-bitcoin-lost-wallet-threat-tether-ceo) 
suggests that most financial institutions will likely be quantum-immune before quantum computers
become a mainstream security risk.

As quantum computing matures, its impact is likely to be **transformative**, much like GPUs and AI 
have been—revolutionising some tasks while serving as an additional tool for others.

### **Final Thoughts**

Quantum computing holds immense promise for the financial sector,
offering both opportunities and risks. While it is not yet ready to
disrupt global financial systems, the race to prepare for its eventual
rise has already begun. Institutions that invest in quantum-readiness
today will be best positioned to navigate the future of finance.
